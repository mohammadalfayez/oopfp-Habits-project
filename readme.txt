App Title:
Habit tracker.


App description:

This is a python based habit tracker application that allows you to keep track of your daily or weekly habits, eg: Exercising, Reading a book, etc..


Instructions:


Importing the database: 

Make sure to import the mysql tables from the database folder to your own mysql server to be able to access the database, it is better to use mysql workbench and choose the 
import from self contained file option.

Add your own mysql connection details like host, user, password, and database name (better to name the database habit_tracker) to the empty string arguments in the init 
function of the database class in the users file.

Do no rename any tables, make sure there is a users table, habits table, and habit_tracking table. Renaming tables will cause errors when storing and retrieving data.


Running the application:

import the mysql connector to the necessary files if it is not already imported.

To start the application run the main_navigator function in the main navigator file which will run all necessary functions.
